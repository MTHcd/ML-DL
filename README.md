## Project Overview
This project integrates human feedback into the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We aim to enhance Transformer-based models (like GPT) by incorporating human feedback to improve accuracy and contextual relevance.

## Project's goals
The goal of this project is to integrate Human Feedback into the training of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Reinforcement Learning (RL). We are aiming to use a Reward Model and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize the performance of LLMs like GPT, through human feedback. This will involve the following steps:
Implement Transformer models.
Train a reward model.
Optimize with PPO.
Generate outputs and validate performance.

## Methodology
1. Load and preprocess data
2. Train PPO model with human feedback
3. Fine-tune the transformer model
4. Generate outputs from the trained model

## Explain the workings of Transformer models, including the mathematical foundation and architecture specifics

## Describe how Reinforcement Learning with human feedback operates, particularly in the context of LLMS

-> check for schemas;
-> describe LLMs;
-> describe logic of RLHF;
--> share your front end experience (Outlier experience);

## In-Depth Explanation of Transformer architectures, causal transformers, and the application of Reinforcement Learning with human feedback in LLMs

Transformer architectures:
=> import schema from paper Attention Is All You Need (https://user.phil.hhu.de/~cwurm/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7181-attention-is-all-you-need.pdf)
=> Explanation in this youtube videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDulhoQ2pro, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCz4OMemCcA

causal transformers:
=> related to which entries in the matrix KQ are changed to - infinity;

application of reinforcement learning with human feedback in LLMs:
=>
